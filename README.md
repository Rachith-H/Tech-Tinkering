# Tech-Tinkering
A collection of my hobby projects in electronics including Arduino-based applications and circuit simulations using LTSpice. This repository highlights my interest in microcontroller programming and circuit simulations. 
It includes:

+ **Arduino Projects** : Hands-on projects<u> demonstrating arduino-based applications, such as automation, sensors, and IoT implementations.  
+ **Circuit Simulations** : Simulations of electronic circuits created using LTSpice covering analog, digital, and mixed-signal designs.
  
Each project is documented with schematics, and output, demonstrating my skills in circuit design, hardware-software integration.    
This repository reflects my curiosity and passion for exploring and experimenting with electronics.
