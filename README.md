# Tech-Tinkering
A collection of my hobby projects in electronics including Arduino-based applications, Verilog digital designs, and circuit simulations using LTSpice. This repository highlights my interest in microcontroller programming, digital circuit design, and simulations. 
It includes:

+ **Arduino Projects** : Hands-on projects<u> demonstrating arduino-based applications, such as automation, sensors, and IoT implementations.  
+ **Circuit Simulations** : Simulations of electronic circuits created using Proteus and LTSpice covering analog, digital, and mixed-signal designs.
+ **Verilog Projects** : Digital design implementations, including combinational and sequential circuits, designed and simulated using Verilog.
  
Each project is documented with code, schematics, and design, demonstrating my skills in circuit design, hardware-software integration, and digital system design.    
This repository reflects my curiosity and passion for exploring and experimenting with electronics.
