# Negative Clipping Circuit

A **negative clipping circuit** is a type of diode-based wave shaping circuit that removes (clips) the negative portion of an input AC signal below a specified voltage level. Negative clipping circuits are commonly used in signal processing, voltage regulation, and waveform shaping applications to limit the lower part of a signal’s amplitude.

## Waveform 
- When the input signal is above the clipping level, the output waveform follows the input.
- When the input signal goes below the clipping level, the output is clipped, resulting in a flat-bottom waveform at the clipping level.

## Applications

1. **Voltage Protection**: Prevents circuits from being damaged by excessively negative voltages.
2. **Wave Shaping**: Used in analog signal processing to create non-sinusoidal waveforms.
3. **Signal Limiting**: Limits the negative portion of signals to avoid distortion or overloading in amplifiers and other circuits.
4. **Data Communication**: Ensures that signals remain within specified voltage levels to maintain data integrity.

## Advantages

- Simple and cost-effective design.
- Can clip signals at any desired negative voltage by adjusting the reference voltage.
- Protects components from excessive negative voltage levels.

---

## Disadvantages

- The output waveform is slightly offset due to the diode’s forward voltage drop (typically 0.7V for silicon diodes).
- Precision clipping may require Schottky diodes (with lower forward voltage drop) or more advanced circuits using op-amps.
